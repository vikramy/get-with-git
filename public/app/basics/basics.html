<h1>Basics</h1>

<p>A git repository consists of three areas. The working directory, staging area, and the .git directory</p>

<h2>Working Directory</h2>

<p>This is the area in your filesystem where you modify existing files and add new ones</p>

<h3>File state</h3>

<p>Files in the working directory and staging area have four states: untracked, unmodified, modified, and finally staged</p>

<h4>Untracked</h4>

<p>Any new files added to the working directory are considered <strong>untracked</strong>.</p>

<h4>Unmodified</h4>

<p>Files in the working area that haven't been changed since the last commit or clone are considered <strong>unmodifed</strong></p>

<h4>Modified</h4>

<p>Files that have been previously commited or were part of the initial clone - and then subsequently changed are considered <strong>modified</strong></p>

<h4>Staged</h4>

<p>Untracked or Modified can be set to the <strong>staged</strong> state by doing a <code>git add</code> command.</p>

<h2>Staging Area</h2>

<p>When you're at a point where you can commit your work. You use the command <code>git add</code> to add the files you wish to commit to the stage</p>

<h2>.git Directory</h2>

<p>After adding files to the staging area, you can commit those files to the .git directory by issuing a <code>git commit</code> command.</p>

<p>This snapshots the commited files, creates an reference to the commit by check-summing them, and pushes that into the local repository.</p>
