<h2>Wiki</h2>

<p>GitHub repositories have the option to have a wiki.</p>

<p>For internal projects, the wiki can be a great place to document design decisions or APIs.</p>

<p>For open source projects, wikis are often used for more detailed documentation.</p>

<p>The wiki is a git repository, so it can be cloned and edited locally.</p>

<h2>Pull requests</h2>

<p>The typical workflow on projects is for members to fork the main repository (upstream) into their own repository (origin).</p>

<p>Once their work is ready to merge into upstream, they'll create a pull request. This will give other team members the opportunity to do a code review at this point.</p>

<p>Team members can comment on individual lines of the pull request.</p>
