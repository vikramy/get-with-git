<h1>What is Git</h1>

<p>Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). When you clone a repository, youâ€™re making a local copy of the entire repository. You can commit, change branches, view commit histories etc - all without a network connection. If a central server dies, it can be restored from any of the copies.</p>
