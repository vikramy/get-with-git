<h2>Git Stash</h2>

<code>git stash</code>

<p>Stashing allows you to take any current modified or staged files and push them into a temporary saved state. This is extremely useful if you have work in progress that isnâ€™t in a state worthy of a commit, but you need to either pull changes from the server, or do some quick work in another branch.</p>

<p>Only modified or staged files will be stashed. If you have untracked files, they would remain in place and you could inadvertently commit them to the wrong branch.</p>

<code>git stash pop</code>

<p>Applies the last saved state</p>
